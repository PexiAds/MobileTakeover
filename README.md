# MobileTakeover
The mobile takeover works similar to the Interscroller in which the content comes into view as the user scrolls the publisher page. The mobile takeover however also includes a rectangle in the top of the page, and a small rectangle at the bottom of the page.

To upload the creative within Pexi you need a Pexi account and access to the correct advertiser. You can request a Pexi account via traffic@pexi.nl. When you have access to Pexi you can upload the banner as a zip (zip the folder, not the files). If you include the IAB size within the filename Pexi will automatically detect and adjust the upload settings.
